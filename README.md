The primary objective of **PathSync** is to develop a **Graph Neural Network (GNN) model** to optimize supply chain routing by effectively predicting the most efficient routes for deliveries. This model aims to enhance delivery speed and accuracy while minimizing costs and environmental impact through data-driven decision-making. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following goals: 

**Develop a GNN-based Model:** Create a robust Graph Neural Network model to optimize routing in supply chain management, leveraging facility and customer location data. 

**Integrate Real-time Data:** Incorporate real-time traffic and weather data to enhance the accuracy and reliability of route predictions. 

**Develop interactive visual reports** using Python libraries such as Folium and Matplotlib to visualize route optimization results, including distance, time, and cost metrics. 

**Provide data-driven forecasts** of route efficiency over various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and estimate their potential impact on operations.

**Deliver Actionable Insights:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations for supply chain managers to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs through optimized routing solutions. 

**Assess Scalability:** Test the model's scalability by applying it to various supply chain scenarios with differing complexities and sizes. 

**Enhance Prediction Accuracy:** Aim to improve the accuracy of delivery time predictions by utilizing the inherent relationships between facilities and customer locations in the GNN framework. 

**Optimize Resource Utilization:** Investigate methods to optimize resource allocation (e.g., vehicles and personnel) based on the optimized routes generated by the GNN model. 

**Develop a User-friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive interface for stakeholders to visualize route optimizations and assess their implications on supply chain operations. 

**Facilitate Decision-Making:** Support decision-making processes by providing comprehensive reports and visualizations that highlight the benefits of adopting GNN- based route optimization.
