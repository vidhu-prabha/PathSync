The primary objective of **PathSync** is to develop a **Graph Neural Network (GNN) model** to optimize supply chain routing by effectively predicting the most efficient routes for deliveries. This model aims to enhance delivery speed and accuracy while minimizing costs and environmental impact through data-driven decision-making. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following goals: 

**Develop a GNN-based Model:** Create a robust Graph Neural Network model to optimize routing in supply chain management, leveraging facility and customer location data. 

**Integrate Real-time Data:** Incorporate real-time traffic and weather data to enhance the accuracy and reliability of route predictions. 

**Develop interactive visual reports** using Python libraries such as Folium and Matplotlib to visualize route optimization results, including distance, time, and cost metrics. 

**Provide data-driven forecasts** of route efficiency over various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and estimate their potential impact on operations.

**Deliver Actionable Insights:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations for supply chain managers to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs through optimized routing solutions. 

**Assess Scalability:** Test the model's scalability by applying it to various supply chain scenarios with differing complexities and sizes. 

**Enhance Prediction Accuracy:** Aim to improve the accuracy of delivery time predictions by utilizing the inherent relationships between facilities and customer locations in the GNN framework. 

**Optimize Resource Utilization:** Investigate methods to optimize resource allocation (e.g., vehicles and personnel) based on the optimized routes generated by the GNN model. 

**Develop a User-friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive interface for stakeholders to visualize route optimizations and assess their implications on supply chain operations. 

**Facilitate Decision-Making:** Support decision-making processes by providing comprehensive reports and visualizations that highlight the benefits of adopting GNN- based route optimization.

**Project Initialization**
Set up the virtual environment.
Install necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Geopy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

**Data Acquisition**
Load UPS facility and customer data into Snowflake database

Retrieve customer address data from the Snowflake database.

**Geocoding**
Use the Google Maps API to convert customer addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.

Store the geocoded coordinates in a DataFrame.

**Data Preprocessing**

Cleab UPS facilty data before loading it into Snowflake databse.

Clean and preprocess the customer address data.

Validate the presence of necessary columns (e.g., Address, City, State, Latitude, Longitude).

**Clustering Customer Addresses**

Implement KMeans clustering to group customer addresses based on proximity (e.g., clustering into groups of 10).

Calculate centroids for each cluster.

**Route Optimization Logic**

For each cluster of customer addresses:

Retrieve nearest UPS facility coordinates based on the cluster centroid.

Implement a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to determine the optimal route.

**Distance and Duration Estimation**

Estimate original and optimized distances and durations for each cluster.

Store these estimations in a structured format.

**Cost and Savings Calculation**

Calculate fuel costs and savings based on distances, fuel efficiency, and fuel prices.

Implement functions to estimate these values for various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

**Data Storage**

Store the results (original distances, optimized distances, durations, fuel costs, and savings) into a DataFrame for further analysis.

**Visualization**

Create visualization for optimized route map.

Create visualizations to compare original vs. optimized distances, durations, and fuel costs using Matplotlib.

Generate summary statistics plots, including comparisons of distances, durations, fuel costs, and savings.

**Results Analysis**
